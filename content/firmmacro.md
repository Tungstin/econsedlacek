We invite submissions for the 2nd edition of the conference on Firm Heterogeneity and the Macroeconomy, to be held **virtually** at the University of Oxford from Thursday 20th to Friday 21st of May, 2021. We welcome submissions in all areas of macroeconomics which explicitly consider firm heterogeneity, either empirically or theoretically.  

Acknowledging the fact that the past year has been particularly difficult for our young colleagues, we especially encourage and welcome submissions from economists at the beginning of their careers.  

We are delighted to announce that **Hugo Hopenhayn** (University of California Los Angeles) will deliver the keynote speech at this event.  

The deadline for submissions is **March 31st, 2021**. Please email your paper to [firm.macro@gmail.com](mailto:firm.macro@gmail.com). Decisions will be announced by the middle of April.  


The Organizing Committee:  

Petr Sedláček (University of Oxford)  
Vincent Sterk (University College London)  
Gabriel Ulyssea (University College London)
