Petr is a macroeconomist with a particular interest in the vast heterogeneity among workers and firms. He is fascinated by the question of how worker and firm heterogeneity interacts and how it shapes, and is shaped by, the aggregate economy. His research combines empirical analysis of micro-level and aggregate data for macroeconomic questions and theoretical and quantitative models with heterogeneous agents.
